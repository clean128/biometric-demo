Auth Face - Biometric Authentication API

API Overview
Auth Face is a biometric authentication microservice designed to provide secure user login and identity verification through facial recognition.

The API delivers a complete facial authentication flow, including face capture, liveness detection, and anti-fraud mechanisms, ensuring that only real and authorized users can access protected systems.

Built for server-to-server integration, Auth Face allows platforms to start a biometric session, redirect users to a secure face capture interface, and later retrieve the authentication result using a client-provided state reference (client_state).

For privacy and security, Auth Face does not store facial images. Only irreversible facial embeddings (mathematical representations of biometric features) are processed and stored, significantly reducing the risk of personal data exposure and simplifying compliance with national and international data protection regulations.

Key features include facial login and identity verification, liveness detection to prevent spoofing attempts (such as photos, videos, or replays), biometric conflict detection, and session-based authentication with secure redirects. The architecture is multi-tenant, scalable, and suitable for onboarding flows, recurring logins, and high-risk actions.

Auth Face is ideal for applications that require strong authentication, effective fraud prevention, and a frictionless passwordless user experience.

Auth Face is a biometric authentication API that enables secure login and identity verification using facial recognition, liveness detection, and anti-fraud protection.

Biometric API — Session-Based Flows & Anti-Fraud
A comprehensive guide to implementing secure biometric authentication with built-in fraud prevention.

Overview
This API provides session-based biometric authentication with user redirection to a secure facial capture interface.
All endpoints use HTTP POST methods.

Key Features
✅ Liveness Detection — Prevents photo/video spoofing
✅ Duplicate Prevention (1:N) — Blocks multiple identities
✅ Session Correlation — Secure state management via client_state
✅ Privacy-First — No images/videos sent to client
✅ Auto-Expiring Sessions — Single-use security tokens
Architecture
The API is organized into two main groups:

1. Biometric Flow Endpoints
Interactive sessions requiring facial capture with anti-fraud checks.

2. Management & Control Endpoints
Administrative operations without biometric capture or redirection.

Biometric Flow Endpoints
These endpoints initiate a biometric session and return a secure URL for facial capture.

Available Endpoints
Endpoint	Purpose	Flow Type	Requires external_user_id
POST /biometry/v1/enroll	Register new user with duplicate check	1:N	✅ Yes
POST /biometry/v1/verify	Authenticate existing user	1:1	✅ Yes
POST /biometry/v1/identify	Find user in database	1:N	❌ No
POST /biometry/v1/update_embedding	Update user's biometric data	1:1	✅ Yes
Base Request Payload
All biometric flow endpoints require the following core fields:

{
  "client_state": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "redirect_url": "https://client.example.com/callback"
}
Field Specifications
Field	Type	Required	Description
client_state	string (UUID v4)	✅ Yes	Unique identifier for this biometric session
redirect_url	string (URL)	✅ Yes	Callback URL where user returns after capture
external_user_id	string	Depends	Your internal user identifier (required for enroll/verify/update)
Endpoint Details
1. Enroll — Anti-Fraud Registration
Purpose: Register a new user while preventing duplicate identities.

POST /biometry/v1/enroll

{
  "client_state": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "redirect_url": "https://client.example.com/callback",
  "external_user_id": "user_12345"
}
Anti-Fraud Behavior
Before enrollment, the system performs a 1:N biometric search
If a similar face already exists:
❌ Enrollment is blocked
📋 Result indicates biometric duplication
🚨 Prevents multiple biometric identities for the same individual
> ⚠️ Important: Enrollment is not a simple registration — it is an identity duplication prevention flow.

Use Cases
New user registration
Account creation with biometric verification
Anti-fraud user onboarding
2. Verify — Facial Verification (1:1)
Purpose: Confirm that the person matches a specific known identity.

  "external_user_id": "user_12345"
}
Behavior

Step-by-Step Process
Client calls a biometric flow endpoint
API returns biometry_url
Client redirects the end user
User completes facial capture (with liveness detection)
User is redirected to: redirect_url?client_state={UUID}
Client retrieves the final result

Result Endpoint — Final Decision
Retrieve the final outcome of any biometric session.

POST /biometry/v1/result

{
  "client_state": "session-uuid"
}
Works for:
enroll
verify
identify
update_embedding

Notes
success indicates that the API request was successfully processed
(it does not represent the biometric result).
state corresponds to the client_state provided when the session was created.
flow indicates the biometric operation type.
status reflects the current biometric session state
(pending, in_progress, success, fail, expired).
score represents the biometric confidence score (when applicable).
Biometric internal identifiers (such as subject references) are never exposed in this endpoint.
reason is present only when the session fails.
Clients should poll this endpoint until status is no longer pending or in_progress.
Management & Control Endpoints
These endpoints do not initiate biometric sessions and do not use client_state or redirect_url.
