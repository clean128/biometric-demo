📋 About the Project

We need a developer to create a demo application that integrates the LenzId facial biometrics API (Auth Face API) via RapidAPI.

Link: https://rapidapi.com/lenzid-lenzid-default/api/auth-face-biometric-authentication-api

The goal is to implement a simple and functional biometric registration and verification flow, where the application automatically decides which action to perform based on the user's status.

🎯 Main Objective

Create a local application that:

Allows the user to enter only one identifier (external_user_id)

Automatically checks if they are already registered

Directs to biometric registration or facial verification

Displays the final result of the operation

🛠️ Supported Technologies

You can choose from:

- Node.js
- Python
- PHP
- C# (.NET Core)
- Java (Spring Boot or similar)

The application must run locally (localhost).

🔄 Expected Functional Flow
Step 1: User Input

User enters their external_user_id (e.g., "João")

Step 2: Automatic Status Verification

Endpoint:

POST /wp-json/biometry/v1/users/get

Scenario A — User NOT registered (404)
{
"success": false,

"error": "external_user_not_found"

}

➡️ Application starts biometric registration:

POST /wp-json/biometry/v1/enroll

Scenario B — User ALREADY registered (200)
{
"success": true,

"user": {
"external_user_id": "João",

"status": "enrolled"

}
}

➡️ Application starts facial verification:

POST Step 3: Redirecting to Biometric Capture

Both enroll and verify follow the same pattern.

Before starting any flow, the application must generate a new UUID, which will be used as client_state.

Request:

{
"external_user_id": "João",

"redirect_url": "http://localhost:3000/final",

"client_state": "uuid-generated-by-the-application"

}

API Response:

{
"success": true,

"client_state": "ee94ab30-ed1b-4905-be83-5cfc6c43ae99",

"biometry_url": "https://auth.lenzid.com/?t=..."

}

✅ The application should automatically redirect the user to the biometry_url

Important:

The client_state must be a new UUID for each flow initiated.

This UUID will be reused to query the final result.

Step 4: Automatic Return

After the biometric process, the user automatically returns. To:

http://localhost:3000/final?client_state=YOUR_UUID_HERE

Step 5: Querying the Final Result

Endpoint:

POST /wp-json/biometry/v1/result

Use the client_state received in the URL to query the result.

Expected final display:

✅ Verify approved → “Legitimate client”

❌ Verify failed → “Verification failed”

⚠️ Enroll conflict → “A user with this face already exists”

✅ Mandatory Technical Requirements

Endpoints:

users/get — verify if user exists

enroll — biometric registration

verify — facial verification

result — final result

Conflict Handling (Enroll)

When the face already belongs to another user:

{
"success": true,

"flow": "enroll",

"status": "fail",

"reason": "conflict",

"external_user_id": "user1234",

"score": 0.882876

}

➡️ Display appropriate message to the user.

Security

Mandatory use of environment variables (.env)

RapidAPI key cannot be versioned

.env must be in .gitignore
